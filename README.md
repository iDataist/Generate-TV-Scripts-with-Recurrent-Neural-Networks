# Generate TV Scripts with Recurrent Neural Networks

I built a LSTM Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with PyTorch. I used part of the Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons to train the RNN, which can generate a new, "fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.

Key Skills Demonstrated
- Process the text data
- Build and train a Recurrent Neural Network with PyTorch
- Optimize hyperparameters
